# Compilation of Ritsumeikan University Projects  

This repository contains a collection of project reports I completed during my time at Ritsumeikan University.  

## Statistics Course Projects  

### Midterm Report  
[Wiener Process](https://github.com/biligee23/Compilation-of-Ritsumeikan-university-project/blob/main/Statistics_Midterm_Poster_Biligsaikhan.pdf)  
**Description:**  
In my 2nd-year Statistics course midterm report at Ritsumeikan University, I applied the statistical analysis skills learned up to that point to a random dataset. This project allowed me to enhance my understanding of data analysis, hypothesis testing, and the practical application of statistics to inform decision-making.

### Final Report  
[Model Selection](https://github.com/biligee23/Compilation-of-Ritsumeikan-university-project/blob/main/Statistics_Finals_Model_Selection_Biligsaikhan.pdf)  
**Description:**  
For my 2nd-year Statistics course final project at Ritsumeikan University, I selected the best statistical model for an unknown dataset provided by the professor. This project involved model rejections, MLE calculations, qualitative and quantitative analysis to determine the best fit model for the data (the code for the project is included starting from the page 13).

## Artificial Intelligence Course Project:
[Abstract-based Document Classification](https://github.com/biligee23/Compilation-of-Ritsumeikan-university-project/blob/main/AI_Final_Report_Biligsaikhan.pdf)  
**Description:** 
In my 2nd-year Artificial Intelligence course at Ritsumeikan University, I completed a document classification project using the BERT model. This project involved leveraging natural language processing techniques to classify text documents efficiently, enhancing my understanding of machine learning and deep learning frameworks.

## Group Projects (Project-Based Learning - PBL)  

### PBL2 (3-Person Team – Developer)  
**Project:** System for Detecting Anomalous Behavior  
[Anomalous behavior](https://github.com/biligee23/Compilation-of-Ritsumeikan-university-project/blob/main/PBL2_Anomalous_Action_Detection_System_Biligsaikhan.pdf)  
**Description:**  
In my 1st-year Project-Based Learning team project at Ritsumeikan University, I worked on developing a system to detect anomalous behavior from video footage and automatically send email notifications to authorities. This project involved collaboration, result testing, and transfer learning from image detection model. From this experience, I have enhanced my skills in both teamwork and handling image data.

### PBL3 (5-Person Team – Back-End Developer)  
[AQI heatmap web-app](https://github.com/biligee23/Compilation-of-Ritsumeikan-university-project/blob/main/PBL3_GeoPath_AQI_Map_Biligsaikhan.pdf)  
**Description:**  
In my 2nd-year Project-Based Learning group project at Ritsumeikan University, I managed the back-end development for creating a web-based AQI (Air Quality Index) heatmap. This mostly involved learning to understand and use various web API's to the team's needs. I think this project helped me to grow the most, I learned how to navigate differences in goals and motivation within a team.
